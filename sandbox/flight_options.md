# Best direct-flight options: SYD <-> TAO (Qingdao)

Period: 2025-12-20 to 2026-01-17 (2 to 3 weeks). 3 adults and 1 child. Economy cabin. Direct (nonstop) flights only. Cost is the key factor.

## SYD -> TAO (Sydney to Qingdao)
- Status: No direct (nonstop) round-trip options found within the specified window.
- Note: If you are open to 1-stop itineraries, there may be options with one layover; I can search and price those if you’d like.

## TAO -> SYD (Qingdao to Sydney)
- Status: No direct (nonstop) round-trip options found within the specified window.
- Note: If you are open to 1-stop itineraries, I can search and price those as well.

## Recommendation / Next steps
- If nonstop is mandatory, consider widening the date window (e.g., +/- 3–7 days) or checking alternate nearby airports if any exist.
- If 1-stop itineraries are acceptable, I can search for the cheapest round-trip options with a single connection in economy for 3 adults + 1 child on your date range.
- For cost optimization, consider adjusting travel dates to midweek, and monitor fares via fare alerts.

## Data sources consulted
- Major flight search engines (examples include Trip.com, Skyscanner, Google Flights) for nonstop availability within the specified window.
- If you’d like, I can provide a price-quoted shortlist based on 1-stop options from these sources.
