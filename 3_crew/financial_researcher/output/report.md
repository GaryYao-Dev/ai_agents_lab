### 2. Company Performance and Financial Health

#### 2.1 Current Status (2024 & H1 2025)

Huawei's financial performance in 2024 and H1 2025 indicates a strong recovery trajectory and strategic focus on long-term growth.

*   **Revenue Growth:** In 2024, Huawei's revenue reached an impressive CNY 862.1 billion (approximately USD 118.2 billion), representing a substantial 22.4% year-on-year increase. This marks its second-highest revenue on record, signaling a near full recovery to pre-sanction peak levels. The positive momentum continued into H1 2025, with revenue rising by 4% to CNY 427 billion, its strongest first-half performance since 2020.
*   **Net Profit and R&D Investment:** While revenue soared, net profit experienced a decline. In 2024, net profit was CNY 62.6 billion, a 28% decrease from 2023. This trend persisted in H1 2025, with net profit falling by 32% year-on-year to CNY 37.1 billion (USD 5.1 billion). This decline is not indicative of financial distress but rather a strategic allocation of capital, as the company significantly ramped up its R&D expenditure, reaching CNY 96.9 billion in H1 2025 alone. This heavy investment is crucial for fostering technological independence and future competitiveness in critical areas like chip design and advanced communication technologies.
*   **Business Segment Performance (2024):**
    *   **ICT Infrastructure:** Continued to be a solid performer and a core revenue contributor.
    *   **Consumer Business:** Witnessed a robust comeback, particularly in the smartphone market. Huawei's smartphone shipments in China surged by 37% year-on-year in 2024, elevating its domestic market share from 12% in 2023 to 16%. This segment's resurgence is a testament to successful product development and brand loyalty.
    *   **Cloud Computing Business:** Generated CNY 68.8 billion in revenue, highlighting its growing importance within Huawei's diversified portfolio.
*   **Geographic Contribution:** China remains Huawei's primary market, contributing over 71% of its total revenue in 2024. This strong domestic base provides a stable foundation for revenue and a testing ground for new technologies amidst international market restrictions.

In summary, Huawei's current health is characterized by aggressive revenue growth and a strategic commitment to R&D, positioning it for long-term technological leadership despite short-term profit fluctuations.

#### 2.2 Historical Company Performance
